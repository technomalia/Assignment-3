# Assignment-3 | Our IT Project
## Repository for our second group assignment
I've created a named folder for each group-member in this repository which I'd suggest we all upload our working files too or at <i>least</i> upload files into once they're finished. I've also added a <code>README.md</code> file to everyone's directory but only because the empty folders wouldn't upload/push to the repo, so feel free to delete <code>[your_name]/README.md</code> as soon as you like.
This repository is completely seperate to the group website one so you can all just go ahead and treat this repo like a little sandbox and mess around without fear of deleting anything we need, at least for now.
