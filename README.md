# Assignment-3 | "Our IT Project"

## Notes
I've created a named folder for each group-member in this repository which I'd suggest we all upload our working files too or at <i>least</i> upload files into once they're finished. I've also added a <code>README.md</code> file to everyone's directory but only because empty folders won't push to the repo, so feel free to delete <code>[your_name]/README.md</code> as soon as you've uploaded anything into that directory.
This repository is completely seperate to the group website so you can all just go ahead and treat this repo like a sandbox and mess around without fear of deleting anything we need, at this point anyhow.

## Using Github
Though I am still unclear what days we're meant to be holding group discussions and unsure whether I'm meant to try and teach the four of you how to use this platform, It would probably be easier anyway to simple add a step-by-step right here - with notes - to tell you what do to because it's really, yeah: at our level it's really not hard at all - all we are needing to do is clone the repository and upload/update files as we go and functions like forking etcetera are nothing we have to concern ourselves with and probably won't for the duration of the unit.

On with it anyway.

I'll add screenshots I suppose but yeah that'll double the time it takes to write this section..

   ### 1. Clone this repository
   In whatever browser you use, navigate to https://github.com/technomalia/Assignment-3 and make sure you're logged-in.

   Click on the green CODE button towards the right up near the top, then click the COPY link next to the URL...

   Now open Github Desktop if you haven't already and select <kbd>File->Clone Repository...</kbd> or press <kbd>CTRL + SHIFT + O</kbd> to open the Clone Repo dialog..

   <img src="https://psychaesthetic.com.au/photobox/images/2020/08/04/step-2.png" width="100%">

   Select the <b>URL tab</b> on the right.
   
   Press <kbd>CTRL + V</kbd> in the top text field to paste the source repositories URL in.

   Finally, click <kbd>CHOOSE</kbd> at the right of the bottom text-field and find a folder you want to clone the repository to: this is the only bit that requires any thinking at all because you need to remember where that folder is and I've chosen <code><b>//documents/github/repositories/</b></code> as my own base folder for all repositories just because it's neater that way, though you can just shove 'em on your desktop in individual folders scattered everywhere if you like - up to you.

   <u>One last thing:</u> Github Desktop will <i>automatically</i> create the containing folder when it copies the repository files to your computer - you <i>don't need</i> to create the repo's folder: say for example, you create a folder at <code><b>//desktop/repositories/assignment-03/</b></code> after clicking <kbd>CHOOSE</kbd>, you'll end-up with the cloned repository being copied to <code><b>//desktop/repositories/assignment-03/assignment-03/</b></code>

   Anyway wherever you decide to clone the repository on your local machine, pick somewhere easy to access and maybe create a shortcut then copy/paste it to your desktop for easy access because, just because.

   ### 2. Using the repository

   Once you've cloned the repository to your local machine, use Windows Explorer or whatever file system thing you have to open the folder that's just been created and check there are files there - you should have this..

   <img src="https://psychaesthetic.com.au/photobox/images/2020/08/04/local-repo.png" width="100%">

   From this point on, all you will need to use Github Desktop for is updating the repository whenever you edit or add or delete files from your local repository folder: that's all github is used for.

   Git constantly scans all files in the repository folder and any changes that're made are logged and shown within Github's Desktop application isntantly: whether you've heavily edited a word document, added or removed file(s) from the repo's directory or changed a single character in a text document git will track those changes and as soon as you open the program it'll show you the changes that need to be committed and pushed to the remote folder (or pulled to your local folder if someone else has made any changes) and will look like this..

   <img src="https://psychaesthetic.com.au/photobox/images/2020/08/04/changes.png" width="100%">

   That's obviously only one file because all I've changed is this README.md as I've written it, but when <b>you</b> have a copy of the repository on <b>your</b> local machine, Github will notify you that new changes have been made and demand you <b>PULL</b> the changes from the remote copy to your local copy of the repository and watch - if I cut/paste the screenshot images into <b>my own</b> local copy of the repository folder then switch back to GitHub Desktop, it will show all the *.png files I've added..

   <img src="https://psychaesthetic.com.au/photobox/images/2020/08/04/plus-images.png" width="100%">

   So I click <b>COMMIT TO MASTER</b> to accept the changes being incuded in the next push, then go ahead and click <b>PUSH</b> and those images will be uploaded to the remote repo folder and Github would now inform all you to <b>PULL</b> the changes next time you open Github Desktop or even just switch back to the app if it's already running.

   That's it really.
   
   If you use //assignment-3/[your-name]/ as your working folder for any files; spreadsheets, word documents, PDFs, images and anything else you're working on, then Github will make it easy as sh!t for everyone to keep the remote repository files as up-to-date as your local copies are and we can each access the latest version of everyone elses work if we need to reference or inclide it in our own.

   If that clear enough without being condescending? 

   I tried to explain everything completely and though it might read a bit patronizing in bits here and there, it's not meant to - just meant to explain how Git and Github function so you can all clone a copy of our repository - or repositories if you want - whenever you're ready and without needing to have me sit-down in a chat session and try to explain it all live.

  That <b>should</b> be enough, everyone <b>should</b> at least be able to clone //Assignment-3/ after reading this and use their named directory as a working folder for the assignment; which we probably should because it demonstrates everyone knows how to use Git and Github and also keeps track of what everyone is doing.

   Any questions about anything I've been unclear on, you can all shoot at me in Whatssapp or Teams, or text even if you like.

   And when I say PUSH, it actually displays on the buttons usually as <kbd><b>Push origin</b></kbd> and COMMIT is <i>actually</i> <kbd><b>Commit to master</b></kbd> but it's the same thing.
