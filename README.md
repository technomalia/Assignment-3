# Assignment-3 | "Our IT Project"

## Notes
I've created a named folder for each group-member in this repository which I'd suggest we all upload our working files too or at <i>least</i> upload files into once they're finished. I've also added a <code>README.md</code> file to everyone's directory but only because empty folders won't push to the repo, so feel free to delete <code>[your_name]/README.md</code> as soon as you've uploaded anything into that directory.
This repository is completely seperate to the group website so you can all just go ahead and treat this repo like a sandbox and mess around without fear of deleting anything we need, at this point anyhow.

## Using Github
Though I am still unclear what days we're meant to be holding group discussions and unsure whether I'm meant to try and teach the four of you how to use this platform, It would probably be easier anyway to simple add a step-by-step right here - with notes - to tell you what do to because it's really, yeah: at our level it's really not hard at all - all we are needing to do is clone the repository and upload/update files as we go and functions like forking etcetera are nothing we have to concern ourselves with and probably won't for the duration of the unit.

On with it anyway.

I'll add screenshots I suppose but yeah that'll double the time it takes to write this section..

   ### 1. Clone this repository
   In whatever browser you use, navigate to https://github.com/technomalia/Assignment-3 and make sure you're logged-in.

   Click on the green CODE button towards the right up near the top, then click the COPY link next to the URL...

   Now open Github Desktop if you haven't already and select <kbd>File->Clone Repository...</kbd> or press <kbd>CTRL + SHIFT + O</kbd> to open the Clone Repo dialog..

   Select the <b>URL tab</b> on the right.
   
   Press <kbd>CTRL + V</kbd> in the top text field to paste the source repositories URL in.

   Finally, click <kbd>CHOOSE</kbd> at the right of the bottom text-field and find a folder you want to clone the repository to: this is the only bit that requires any thinking at all because you need to remember where that folder is and I've chosen <code><b>//documents/github/repositories/</b></code> as my own base folder for all repositories just because it's neater that way, though you can just shove 'em on your desktop in individual folders scattered everywhere if you like - up to you.

   <u>One last thing:</u> Github Desktop will <i>automatically</i> create the containing folder when it copies the repository files to your computer - you <i>don't need</i> to create the repo's folder: say for example, you create a folder at <code><b>//desktop/repositories/assignment-03/</b></code> after clicking <kbd>CHOOSE</kbd>, you'll end-up with the cloned repository being copied to <code><b>//desktop/repositories/assignment-03/assignment-03/</b></code>

   Anyway wherever you decide to clone the repository on your local machine, pick somewhere easy to access and maybe create a shortcut then copy/paste it to your desktop for easy access because, just because.

   ### 2. Using the repository

   Once you've cloned the repository to your local machine, use Windows Explorer or whatever file system thing you have to open the folder that's just been created and check there are files there - you should have this..

   From this point on, all you will need to use Github Desktop for is updating the repository whenever you edit or add or delete files from your local repository folder: that's all github is used for.

   Git constantly scans all files in the repository folder and any changes that're made are logged and shown within Github's Desktop application isntantly: whether you've heavily edited a word document, added or removed file(s) from the repo's directory or changed a single character in a text document git will track those changes and as soon as you open the program it'll show you the changes that need to be committed and pushed to the remote folder (or pulled to your local folder if someone else has made any changes) and will look like this..

   That's obviously only one file because all I've changed is this README.md as I've written it, but if I went and added a few images they'd show as changes needing to be committed as well...
